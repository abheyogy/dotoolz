My dotools
----------

Most people call them dotfiles, I call them dotools.

Note: Partially broken ZSH for Mac. Becareful there. Too busy to update my fixed Mac compatible Zsh files, will do it sometime soon.

Philosophy (Two Cents)
----------------------

Everybody loves beauty, everything tries to achieve beauty through symmetry. To create beautiful software, a hacker
writes inspirational poems in any given language and has a set of beautiful tools.

A skilled craftsman will spend 60-70% of his times building and maintaining his tools while spending only 30-40% on
the real work. If there is no personal care given to one's tools, one is simply a mindless worker a.k.a. coder.

History
-------

These dotfiles have been created, updated and maintained from last 15 years of my experience. This has been inspired by
various hackers during my travels around the Earth, as my travels have given me ample opportunity to meet various people from various
backgrounds, I find myself left with an awesome repository of various tools in various languages doing various
different things.

I look up to this as an essential summary, a churned out, refined nectar & plan to churn this till the end of my hacker life.

Vision
------

To have a one click setup for all of my tools related to my hacker ego; These tools should setup a ubiquitous environment
on all major Linux/Mac/Windows platforms and provide me with more time to chill, relax, spend time with my friends & play
music.

- These tools should be a comprehensive set which should automate and delegate things off GUI to provide a context switch free
work environment.
- These tools should allow me to retain my focus and be in a meditative state of flow for as long as I wish to work.

RoadMap
-------

- [] Update Vimrc for the following languages:
   - [] Python
   - [] Scala
   - [] C/C++
   - [] Go Lang
   - [] BASH
- [] Update my ZSH environment
- [] Update multi distro logic
- [] Create symlink installer logic
- [] Fine tune for each given platform:
  - [] Linux & Its Flavors
  - [] Mac OS X
  - [] Windows
- [] Figure out a unique way to test all of these
- [] Work on the roadmap!
